# SEMANTIC-SEGMENTATION-USING-UNET
I have developed this model using tensorflow and trained my model on google colab by importing dataset directly from kaggle using kaggle API
you can further use this model for self driving cars i have not used any pretrained model beacause i believe in developing everything from
scratch and try to keep my code simple thats why i only used single file to write code
